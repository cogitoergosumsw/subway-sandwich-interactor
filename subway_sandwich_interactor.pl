The prolog script offers different meal options, sandwich options, meat options, salad options, sauce options, top-up options, sides options etc. to create a customized list of personâ€™s choice. The options should be intelligently selected based on previous choices. For example, if the person chose a veggie meal, meat options should not be offered. If a person chose healthy meal, fatty sauces should not be offered. If a person chose vegan meal, cheese top-up should not be offered. If a person chose value meal, no top-up should be offered.
